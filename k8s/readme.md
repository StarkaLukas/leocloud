# Cloud Deployment

To work with the cloud you must have [kubectl] installed. The subfolder parts contain the files to deploy the application to your cloud account in the selected cloud namespace. 

Before you can use this you must do the following:

- Install your config file into your ~/.kube folder
- edit the .yaml files and adjust the namespace and username for your account

   Replace _caberger_ with  your github account name and c.aberger with the base url of your cloud ingress.
